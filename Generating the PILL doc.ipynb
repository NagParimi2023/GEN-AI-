PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\\nText: 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\\n\\nPharmacotherapeutic groups: Immunosuppressants, Selective Immunosuppressants; ATC\\ncode:  L04AA29\\n\\nMechanism of action\\n\\nTofacitinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of the JAK family. In enzymatic assays, tofacitinib inhibits\\nJAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent TyK2. In contrast, tofacitinib has a high degree of\\nselectivity against other kinases in the human genome. In human cells, tofacitinib preferentially\\ninhibits signalling by heterodimeric cytokine receptors that associate with JAK3 and/or JAK1 with functional select ivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2. Inhibition of JAK1 and\\nJAK3 by tofacitinib attenuates signalling of interleukins (IL -2, -4, -6, -7, -9, -15, -21) and type I and\\ntype II interferons, which will result in modulation of the immune  and inflammatory response.\\n\\nPharmacodynamic effects\\n In patients with RA, treatment up to 6  months with tofacitinib  was associated with dose- dependent\\nreductions of circulating CD16/56+ natural killer (NK) cells, with estimated maximum reductions\\noccurring at approximately 8- 10 weeks after initiation of therapy. These changes generally resolved\\nwithin 2 -6 weeks after discontinuation of treatmen t. Treatment with tofacitinib  was associated with\\ndose-dependent increases in B cell counts. Changes in circulating T -lymphocyte counts and\\nT-lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+) were small and inconsistent.\\n 22 Following long- term treatment (median duration of tofacitinib  treatment of approximately 5  years),\\nCD4+ and CD8+ counts showed median reductions of 28% and 27%, respectively, from baseline. In\\ncontrast to the observed decrease after short -term dosing, CD16/56+ natural killer cell counts showed\\na median increase of 73% from baseline. CD19+ B cell counts showed no further increases after\\nlong- term tofacitinib  treatment. All these lymphocyte subset changes returned toward baseline after\\ntemporary discontinuation of treatment. There was no evidence of a  relationship between serious or\\nopportunistic infections or herpes zoster and lymphocyte subset counts  (see section 4.2 for absolute\\nlymphocyte count monitoring).\\n\\nChanges in total serum IgG, IgM, and IgA levels over 6 -month tofacitinib  dosing in patients  with RA\\nwere small, not dose -dependent and similar to those seen on placebo, indicating a lack of systemic\\nhumoral suppression.\\n\\nAfter treatment with tofacitinib  in RA patients, rapid decreases in serum C -reactive protein (CRP)\\nwere observed and maintaine d throughout dosing. Changes in CRP observed with tofacitinib  treatment\\ndo not reverse fully within 2  weeks after discontinuation, indicating a longer duration of\\npharmacodynamic activity compared to the half -life.\\n\\nVaccine studies\\n In a controlled clinica l trial of patients with RA initiating tofacitinib  10 mg twice daily or placebo, the\\nnumber of responders to influenza vaccine was similar in both groups: tofacitinib  (57%) and placebo\\n(62%). For pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine the number of responders  was as follows: 32% in\\npatients receiving both tofacitinib  and MTX; 62% for tofacitinib  monotherapy; 62% for MTX\\nmonotherapy; and 77% for placebo. The clinical significance of this is unknown, however, similar results were obtained in a separate vaccine s tudy with influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide\\nvaccines in patients receiving long- term tofacitinib  10 mg twice daily .\\n A controlled study was conducted in patients with RA on background MTX immunised with a live\\nattenuated herpes virus vaccine 2 to 3  weeks before initiating a 12 -week treatment with tofacitinib\\n5 mg twice daily or placebo. Evidence of humoral and cell -mediated responses to VZV was observed\\nin both tofacitinib  and placebo -treated patients at 6  weeks. These responses were similar to thos e\\nobserved in healthy volunteers aged 50 years and older. A patient with no previous history of varicella\\ninfection and no anti -varicella antibodies at baseline experienced dissemination of the vaccine strain\\nof varicella 16  days after vaccination. Tofacit inib was discontinued and the patient recovered after\\ntreatment with standard doses of antiviral medication. This patient subsequently made a robust,\\nthough delayed, humoral and cellular response to the vaccine (see section 4.4).\\n\\nClinical efficacy and safety\\n\\nRheumatoid arthritis\\nThe efficacy and safety of tofacitinib  film-coated tablets  were assessed in 6  randomised, double -blind,\\ncontrolled multicentre studies in patients greater than 18  years of age with active RA diagnosed\\naccording to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.
