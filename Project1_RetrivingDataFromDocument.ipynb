They commonly gain your personal information by posing as another person or business, or by stealing your passwords. This is usually done by SMS or email phishing, and via telephone scams. This information is then often used to make unauthorised transactions on your accounts.\\n\\nHow can I keep my accounts safe?\\n\\nKeep your devices, PIN and passwords secure so that nobody can gain access or discover this information.\\n\\n(cid:127) Memorise your codes and delete or destroy any record of them.\\n\\n(cid:127) If you are waiting for your card in the mail, secure your letterbox at all times.\\n\\n(cid:127) Don't tell anyone your passwords or PINs - including family, friends and anyone who claims they are from the bank.\\n\\n(cid:127) Don't choose any passwords or PINs which are easily guessed, such as your birthday, name, phone number, or numbers which form a pattern.\\n\\nKeep your cards and devices safe, take extra care of your online wallets and mobile banking applications.\\n\\n(cid:127) Activate and set a PIN on your card as soon as you receive it.\\n\\n(cid:127) Regularly check your card is still in your possession.\\n\\n(cid:127) Cancel, cut up and securely dispose of any card you no longer use.\\n\\n(cid:127) Don't let anyone else register their own thumbprint or other biometrics on your device.\\n\\n(cid:127) Don't leave your card unattended when you are in public, including at work.\\n\\nHas there been an unauthorised transaction on your account?\\n\\n1. Double check that the transaction was not made by you, or an authorised person on the account.\\n\\n2. Document the incorrect transaction.\\n\\n3. Contact the merchant that charged you (most issues can be resolved faster that way).\\n\\nFor more information, visit: commbank.com.au/support/disputing-a-transaction.html\\n\\nIf this issue is still unresolved, contact us within 30 days of your transaction statement date, and we may be able to exercise our chargeback rights to recover your funds.\\n\\nPlease note: We cannot request a chargeback on BPAY payments because different rules apply (these rules are set out in the ePayments Code).\\n\\nTo find out more about chargebacks, visit: commbank.com.au/support/faqs/1387.html\\n\\nImportant information: This document is a guideline only. If you don't take reasonable measures to protect your cards and devices, or protect your personal and security information, or prevent others from accessing such information, you may be liable for any unauthorised transactions. Your liability for any losses arising from unauthorised transactions is determined in accordance with the ePayments Code and is set out in your account Terms and Conditions.
